# Lesson 1

To complete this lesson you will need to install `pygame`.  It is easy, on Windows, open the `cmd` prompt by going to the Start menu and typing `cmd`.  Once it is listed, open it.  From the command prompt type `pip install pygame`.

## What is `pygame` anyway?
`pygame` is a bucn of code written by good coders which helps us create games in Python.  All of their code can be added to our own code by installing the library, like we just did, and then add:

```python
import pygame
```

At the beginning of our own code.

## Run the `lesson_1.py`
Let's start by running the first lesson.  Open Visual Studio Code and find the `lesson_1.py` file.  Once open, hit the "Run" button.
